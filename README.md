# 09 Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator

## Description

The MarkdownMagic App allows the user to create a high quality readme by utilizing node.js and the inquirer prompts. When the user initializes the app they are given prompts in the terminal. The user's responses are then stored as data which is access by the filesystem to dynamically create a readme.md file based on their inputs.

## Tasks 

- Used the file system and inquirer package to prompt the user as well as dynamically generate a readme.
- App creates multiple sections that are filled in by user responses.
- The app also applies the users chosen license to the readme, which is displayed as a badge, link, and the license info.
- Created a video that describes the app. See Usage for more info.
